## Introduction

SQL Injection (SQLI) is a code injection technique that might destroy your database. It is one of the most common web hacking techniques. This article will help you understand what SQL Injection is, how it works, and how to protect your applications from it.

## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a type of attack that allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, data corruption, or even complete control over the database server.

## How SQL Injection Works

SQL Injection typically occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and is directly included in an SQL query. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';
```

If an attacker inputs `admin' --` as the username, the query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = '';
```

Another common technique is to use UNION-based SQL Injection to retrieve data from other tables. For example:

```sql	
SELECT * FROM users WHERE category = '1' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL --';
```

In this case, the attacker is trying to retrieve data from another table by injecting a UNION statement into the query. The `NULL` values are used to match the number of columns in the original query.

The `--` comment sequence causes the rest of the query to be ignored, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.

## Types of SQL Injection

1. **In-band SQLi**: The attacker uses the same communication channel to launch the attack and gather results.
2. **Inferential (Blind) SQLi**: The attacker sends payloads to the server and observes the response to infer the structure of the database.
3. **Out-of-band SQLi**: The attacker uses different channels to perform the attack and retrieve data.
