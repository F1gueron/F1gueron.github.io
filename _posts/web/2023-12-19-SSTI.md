## Introduction

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a type of vulnerability that occurs when user input is embedded in templates in an unsafe manner. This can lead to remote code execution on the server.

## How SSTI Works

SSTI vulnerabilities arise when a web application uses a template engine to render user input without proper validation or sanitization. Attackers can inject malicious code into the template, which is then executed on the server.

## Common Template Engines

Some common template engines that may be vulnerable to SSTI include:

- Jinja2 (Python)
- Twig (PHP)
- Velocity (Java)
- Freemarker (Java)
- Smarty (PHP)

## Example

The first step is to find out the template using the POC, there are a lot of ways to prove this, that are some inputs, and the input that works, determines which template itâ€™s using the web page.

Here is a simple example of a vulnerable template in Jinja2:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/greet')
def greet():
    name = request.args.get('name', 'World')
    template = f"Hello, {name}!"
    return render_template_string(template)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

If an attacker sends a request to `/greet?name={7*7}`, the server will render `Hello, 49!`, demonstrating the execution of the injected code.
