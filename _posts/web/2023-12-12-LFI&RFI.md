## Introduction

Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) are common vulnerabilities found in web applications. These vulnerabilities occur when an application includes files without properly sanitizing the input, allowing attackers to manipulate the file path.

## Local File Inclusion (LFI)

LFI allows an attacker to include files on a server through the web browser. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, code execution, and other malicious activities.

### Example

```php
<?php
$file = $_GET['file'];
include($file);
?>
```

In this example, an attacker can manipulate the `file` parameter to include arbitrary files from the server.

## Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

RFI allows an attacker to include remote files through the web browser. This can lead to remote code execution and other malicious activities.

### Example

```php
<?php
$file = $_GET['file'];
include('http://example.com/' . $file);
?>
```

In this example, an attacker can manipulate the `file` parameter to include files from a remote server.

Another example is when the attacker can include/exclude a file from the server, but the file is not sanitized, so the attacker can include/exclude a file that is not supposed to be included.

```html
http://<attacking web>/../../../../../../flag.txt>
http://<attacking web>/index.php?<token>=archivo.php <!--LFI--><!--token can be file-->
```

There are a lot of [wrappers](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php) than can be used.

For example
```html
expect://<code> <!--lets u use code--><!-- {cat, id, ls, ...} -->
```
