# Permx Writeup

## 1. Service Enumeration

As usual, we start with an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services.

We can see that there are two open ports: 22 and 80.

After looking a bit at the web at port 80 and not finding anything interesting, we decide to check for subdomains.

## 2. Web Recon

At lms.permx.htb we find a login page hosted by Chamilo LMS.

We can try to find some default credentials to login, but this didn't work for me. After some time, I found [CVE-2023-4220](https://github.com/Ziad-Sakr/Chamilo-CVE-2023-4220-Exploit) which is a RFI with code execution that allows us to bypass the login page.

Here we can see other reverse shells probably of other users that have exploited the vulnerability, so this is a good sign.

## 3. Lateral Movement

After getting a shell, we land as the user `www-data` and we can see that there is a user called `mtz` in the machine.
While looking for credentials or other type of information to get to the user `mtz`, we find a configuration file for the database that contains the password for the user `chamilo`.

</p>

After diging a bit in the database, we find nothing, so we can try to use that password to login as the user `mtz` in the machine, and it works.

## 4. Privilege Escalation

When landing as `mtz`, after reading user.txt, we can see that `mtz` can run `sudo -l` without password.

Now, we just need a way of using acl.sh to escalate privileges. First, lets see what acl.sh does.

This script is used to change permission of a file, so we can use it to change the permission of /etc/sudoers to give us sudo permissions.

We can achive this by creating a file and giving it a symbolic link to /etc/sudoers.

```bash
ln -s /etc/sudoers figueron
sudo /opt/acl.sh mtz rw /home/mtz/figueron
``` 

Now we can edit /etc/sudoers and add the following line to give us sudo permissions.

```bash
mtz ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
