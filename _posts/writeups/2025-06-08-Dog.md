# Dog Writeup

## Table of Contents

1. [Service Enumeration](#1-service-enumeration)
2. [Web Recon](#2-web-recon)
3. [Privilege Escalation](#3-privilege-escalation)

## 1. Service Enumeration

We begin with an `nmap` scan. Port 80 is open, so the hostname is added to `/etc/hosts` and the web page is visited.

## 2. Web Recon

The scan reveals exposed files and a `.git` repository. To download the repository, use:
- [GitDumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper.git)

After downloading, a database password is found in `settings.php`.

    alt="Found credentials in settings.php">
</p>

Attempting SSH with these credentials fails.

Next, further file enumeration is performed since TruffleHog found nothing in the repository. A file at `http://dev.dog.htb/files/config_83dddd18e1ec67fd8ff5bba2453c7fb3/active/update.settings.json` contains a username.

    alt="Found username in update.settings.json">
</p>

Trying SSH with username `tiffany` and the found password fails, but logging into the Backdrop CMS service with these credentials succeeds.

Researching exploits for Backdrop CMS, the following was found:
- [Exploit 1](https://grimthereaperteam.medium.com/backdrop-cms-1-22-0-unrestricted-file-upload-layouts-ce49a6b7e521) (did not work due to .zip restriction)
- [Backdrop CMS RCE](https://github.com/ajdumanhug/CVE-2022-42092) (successful)

Using the RCE exploit, a reverse shell is obtained as `www-data`.

With this user, the user flag cannot be read, but `/etc/passwd` reveals other users. Trying the previously found password for user `johncusack` works, allowing access to the user flag.

## 3. Privilege Escalation

Running `sudo -l` as `johncusack` shows permission to run `/usr/local/bin/bee` as root.

</p>

Analyzing the binary, one option allows execution of PHP code. To read `/etc/shadow`:
```bash
sudo bee --root=/var/www/html eval 'echo file_get_contents("/etc/shadow");'
```

    alt="Reading /etc/shadow">
</p>

To read the root flag:
```bash
sudo bee --root=/var/www/html eval 'echo file_get_contents("/root/root.txt");'
```

Done!!
