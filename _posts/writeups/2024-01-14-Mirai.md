## 1. Service Enumeration
As usual, we start with an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services.

```bash	
figueron@kali$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 10.10.10.48

```

We can see that there are several open ports: 22, 53, 80, 1877, 32400, and 32469.

The landing page is an empty page, so we decide to check for directory brute-forcing.

## 2. Web Recon

```bash
figueron@kali$ feroxbuster -u http://10.10.10.48

```

Here we can see that there is a directory called `admin` that we can access.

Here we can find some valuable information, such as that this was designed for **Raspberry Pi**, but at first I didnt notice that. So I continued with other ports.

## 3. Exploring Other Open Ports

We can look at the other ports to see if we can find something interesting.

### Port 53

Here we can try to do a zone transfer with:
    
```bash
dig axfr @10.10.10.48 [zone]
```

As we dont know any hostnames, we can try to with HTB patterns ushc as `mirai`, `mirai.htb` or `htb.mirai`, but we aren't lucky.

### Port 32400

We can try to access the Plex Media Server at `http://10.10.1.0.48:32400/web` but we need to login. We can try default credentials, but they don't work. Here we can register and login to see if we can find something interesting.

But sadly, inside there is nothing interesting but the version of the Plex Media Server, which was not vulnerable at the time I did this machine (maybe now it is, dont forget to check for CVE's).

### Port 22

One of the things I learned of real hacking attacks at university, is that there was a real malware called Mirai that was used to infect IoT devices. This malware was used to create a botnet that was used to perform DDoS attacks. 

<!-- markdownlint-capture -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
> Mirai’s go-to attack was to brute force common default passwords. In fact, mirai-botnet.txt was added to SecLists in November 2017.
{: .prompt-tip }
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

So we can try a default credentials for ssh of a raspberry pi, which is `pi:raspberry`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/writeupImgs/mirai/1_K9rPwTBiBhr8ml6_iOaN_g.webp" width="700"
    alt="Descripción">
</p>

Now we can see that we have access to the machine as the user `pi`, who can read the user flag.

## 4. Privilege Escalation

After reading the user flag, we can see that the user `pi` can run `sudo -l` without password.

This will means that pi can run any command as root without password, so we just need to run `sudo su` to get a root shell and read the root flag.

### Root Flag

```bash	
root@raspberrypi:~# cat root.txt 
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```

It cant be so easy 😉

At this point we can try to find the USB stick and see if we can find the backup of the root flag.

```bash
root@raspberrypi:~# mount
...[snip]...
/dev/sdb on /media/usbstick type ext4 (ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,data=ordered)
tmpfs on /run/user/999 type tmpfs ...[snip]...
```

We can go look at the USB stick and see if we can find the backup of the root flag.

```bash
root@raspberrypi:~# cd /media/usbstick
root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# ls -la
...[snip]...
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 129 Aug 14 05:19 dammit.txt
root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# cat dammit.txt
Dammit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

-James
```

Now we can see that that was deleted, but as usb stick was mounted on /dev/sdb, and with the philosophy of Linux, we can think that the files are still there, but the inode was deleted. This means that the content is still there, but the system doesn't know where it is. So we can try to recover the file with for example using `strings` to /dev/sdb.

```bash
strings /dev/sdb
```

This will give us some output in which we can see the root flag.

Done!!
