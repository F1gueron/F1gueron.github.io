## 2. TCP-80

There is an active service on port 80 and, as you can see from the nmap output, it redirects us to *https://bizness.htb*, so before connecting, we add it in `/etc/hosts`.

Not seeing anything interesting I started [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch).

```bash
└─$ dirsearch -u https://bizness.htb --exclude-status 403,404,500,502,400,401

Trying to connect to the first result obtained I am redirected to the [OFBiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_OFBiz) login page.

## 3. CVE-2023-51467

Having the system version

<p>
  <img src="assets/img/bizzness/version.png" 
  alt="Descripción"/>
</p>

I started looking for vulnerabilities and I found [CVE-2023-51467](https://www.letsdefend.io/blog/exploitation-analysis-of-apache-ofbiz-zero-day-vulnerabilities-cve-2023-49070-cve-2023-51467#:~:text=CVE%2D2023%2D51467%20is%20a,without%20requiring%20any%20prior%20authentication.), thanks to which it is possible to bypass authentication and execute commands. So I found an [exploit](https://github.com/jakabakos/Apache-OFBiz-Authentication-Bypass) for that CVE and performed a reverse shell.

<p>
  <img src="assets/img/bizzness/shell (1).png" 
  alt="Descripción"/>
</p>


We can have a better shell with the following command:

- python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
- CTRL + Z
- stty raw -echo; fg
- export TERM=xterm

In */home/ofbiz* there is the user flag.

## 4. User to ROOT

I tried using [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) without success, so, after some exploration, I found an interesting file in */opt/ofbiz/framework/resources/templates/* called *AdminUserLoginData.xml*.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<entity-engine-xml>
    <UserLogin userLoginId="@userLoginId@" currentPassword="{SHA}47ca69ebb4bdc9ae0adec130880165d2cc05db1a" requirePasswordChange="Y"/>
    <UserLoginSecurityGroup groupId="SUPER" userLoginId="@userLoginId@" fromDate="2001-01-01 12:00:00.0"/>
```

So we have the current password but it is of no use. Then I ran a grep on each file to see if there were any passwords that were usable.

```bash
ofbiz@bizness:/opt/ofbiz$ find . -type f -exec strings {} \; | grep "currentPassword"
[...SNIPPET...]
                <eeval-UserLogin createdStamp="2023-12-16 03:40:23.643" createdTxStamp="2023-12-16 03:40:23.445" currentPassword="$SHA$d$uP0_QaVBpDWFeo8-dRzDqRwXQ2I" enabled="Y" hasLoggedOut="N" lastUpdatedStamp="2023-12-16 03:44:54.272" lastUpdatedTxStamp="2023-12-16 03:44:54.213" requirePasswordChange="N" userLoginId="admin"/>
[...SNIPPET...]
```

In the output I found a salted hash referring to the admin (which after looking it up I saw was in */opt/ofbiz/runtime/data/derby/ofbiz/seg0/c54d0.dat*).

While looking for a way to crack the hash I found a [tool](https://github.com/duck-sec/Apache-OFBiz-SHA1-Cracker) that performs this operation on hashes coming from OFBiz.

<p>
  <img src="assets/img/bizzness/crack_hash.png" 
  alt="Descripción"/>
</p>

We use the password found to become superuser.

```bash
ofbiz@bizness:/opt/ofbiz$ su 
su 
Password: monkeybizness

root@bizness:/opt/ofbiz# whoami
whoami
root
```

In */root* there is the root flag.
