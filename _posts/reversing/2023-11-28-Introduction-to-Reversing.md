# Introduction to Reversing

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a subject system to identify the system's components and their interrelationships, and to create representations of the system in another form or at a higher level of abstraction. It is often used to understand how software works, to find vulnerabilities, or to create compatible products.

## Why Reverse Engineering?

Reverse engineering can be used for various purposes, including:

- **Security Analysis**: Identifying vulnerabilities in software to improve security.
- **Software Compatibility**: Ensuring new software works with existing systems.
- **Learning and Education**: Understanding how software works for educational purposes.
- **Digital Preservation**: Recovering lost or outdated software.

## Tools and Techniques

Several tools and techniques are commonly used in reverse engineering:

- **Disassemblers**: Convert machine code into assembly code (e.g., IDA Pro, Ghidra).
- **Debuggers**: Allow step-by-step execution of code to analyze its behavior (e.g., OllyDbg, x64dbg).
- **Decompilers**: Convert binary code back into high-level source code (e.g., Hex-Rays, Snowman).
- **Hex Editors**: Allow manual inspection and modification of binary files (e.g., HxD, 010 Editor).
