> I’m a third-year cybersecurity student at King Juan Carlos University, and honestly, I’m obsessed with all things tech and security. While my coursework covers the basics, I spend a great part of my free time diving into the HTB world of cybersecurity—pentesting, red teaming, and reverse engineering.

What really hooks me is the puzzle-solving aspect of this field. Whether I’m tearing apart malware in Ghidra, exploiting vulnerabilities in a lab environment, or geeking out over binary exploitation, I love how every day feels like a new mystery to crack. And, because of that, im wrinting this blog, to share what i learn and to help others to learn.
